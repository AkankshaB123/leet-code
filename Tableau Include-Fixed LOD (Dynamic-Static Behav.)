Unique differences in INCLUDE vs FIXED LOD

“When do I need the calculation to automatically adjust to the dimensions in the view — and still compute at a finer granularity than the view — without locking it down?”

1. When Do I Need the Calculation to Respect the View's Dimension

Example: Average Sales per Order - DYNAMC BY THE VIEW 
- Business Use-case:
- I want to see average order value when the user changes the view between Category, Region, or Segment.
{INCLUDE [Order ID] : SUM([Sales])}

- This recalculates correctly regardless of what dimensions are on the view.
- When the user adds or removes dimensions, the AOV still stays meaningful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{FIXED [Order ID] : SUM([Sales])}
Works, but it’s locked.

Business Impact:
Perfect for dashboards where users pivot dimensions — e.g., “AOV by Region” or “AOV by Product Category” — and you want the measure to adapt dynamically.
